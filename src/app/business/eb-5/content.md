The EB-5 Immigrant Investor Program is a U.S. immigration program designed to attract foreign investment in exchange for U.S. permanent residency (a green card). Here's how it works:

1. **Investment Requirement**: Investors must make a significant financial investment in a U.S. business. The standard minimum investment is $1,050,000, but it can be reduced to $800,000 if the investment is in a Targeted Employment Area (TEA), which includes rural areas or areas with high unemployment.

2. **Job Creation**: The investment must create or preserve at least 10 full-time jobs for U.S. workers within two years of the investor's admission to the U.S.

3. **Green Card**: In return for their investment, the investor and their immediate family (spouse and unmarried children under 21) can apply for U.S. permanent residency.

4. **Regional Centers**: Investors often choose to invest through EB-5 Regional Centers, which are government-approved entities that pool investments for larger projects. These centers help manage the job creation and economic requirements of the EB-5 program.

The program is especially popular for foreign nationals looking for a path to U.S. residency through economic contribution.
